The data in this directory is the raw output from the attacker gsgx driver and
is organized according to Table 1 in the paper
(https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jo.vanbulck/usenix17.pdf):

- nop.txt + ff_nop.txt: the driver output for respectively an A/D spy
and a Flush+Flush spy for the "nop" experiment (Table 1 row 1)

- register_add.txt + ff_register_add.txt: the driver output for
respectively and A/D spy and a Flush+Flush spy for the "add register"
experiment (Table 1 row 2)

- mem_add.txt + ff_mem_add.txt: the driver output for respectively and
A/D spy and a Flush+Flush spy for the "add memory" experiment (Table 1
row 3)

- cd_nop.txt: the driver output for the "nop nocache" experiment (Table
1 row 4)

- *_r.txt: simply contains the output of 'run_microbenchmark.sh' on the
corresponding raw data file (prints the mean and std dev via R)

Now, the measurements.txt files that you asked for can trivially be
generated with the 'parse_microbenchmarks.py' script as follows:

1. rename the desired driver output txt file to
"measurements_raw.txt" and place it in the same directory as
parse_microbenchmarks.py

2. adjust the INST_LEN variable in parse_microbenchmarks.py according to
the driver output file (see comments: 1 for nop; 4 for register add; 8
for memory add)

3. generate measurements.txt by running ./parse_microbenchmarks.py

Once measurements.txt is generated, you can reproduce the means/std dev
in Table 1 by running the R command in "run_microbenchmark.sh", or you
can generate plot.pdf using "gnuplot plot_hist.gp" (but you should
probably adjust the min/max vars accordingly to see something useful).
